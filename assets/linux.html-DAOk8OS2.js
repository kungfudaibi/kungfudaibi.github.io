Every developer&#39;s growth is intrinsically linked to the selfless contributions of those who came before them.</p><p>By engaging with the open source community, you&#39;ll discover that many resources mentioned in this article are freely available. Actively participating in this collaborative ecosystem will undoubtedly accelerate your learning journey and broaden your horizons as a developer.</p><p>Moreover, contributing to open source projects allows you to give back to the community, hone your skills, and potentially make a lasting impact on the software landscape. It&#39;s a symbiotic relationship that fosters innovation, knowledge sharing, and continuous improvement.</p><h4 id="what-is-open-source" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-open-source"><span>What is Open Source</span></a></h4><p>In simple terms, Open Source is publishing your code so that others can access, modify, and distribute it, within the constraints of the open source license. The essence of Open Source is that software should be shared like knowledge, and on the basis of previous work, better results can be achieved.</p><h4 id="why-open-source" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-open-source"><span>Why Open Source</span></a></h4><p>There are many benefits to Open Source, the most important ones are:</p><ul><li><p>You can see others&#39; code and learn from them, improving your skills.</p></li><li><p>Others can see your code and give you suggestions, helping you improve your code.</p></li></ul><p>However, the Open Source philosophy are faced with some challenges:</p><ul><li><p>Others may use your code without following the open source license.</p></li><li><p>There are some companies that claim to be open source but are not truly open source.</p></li></ul><h3 id="learning-from-failure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#learning-from-failure"><span>Learning from failure</span></a></h3><p>As you may have noticed, Linux isn&#39;t for everyone. When you are embarking on your journey into the Linux world, you may (will) encounter tons of problems, and often there isn&#39;t a diagnosis wizard to help you.</p><p>While Windows restricts the user&#39;s access to the system, making it more user-friendly and seemingly more stable, Linux grants you (the system admin) the supreme power over your system, with which you can do anything you want to your system, which also means you have to be responsible for everything on your system.</p><p>You may encounter various issues and difficulties including but not limited to:</p><ul><li>Getting display glitch after login (almost exclusively <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA/Troubleshooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NVIDIA</a>)</li></ul><blockquote><p>So NVIDIA, F*ck you.<br> Linus Torvalds<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SWxWIOVBM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aalto Center for Entrepreneurship, 2012</a></p></blockquote><ul><li><p>Don&#39;t know how to connect to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Network_configuration/Wireless" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wireless network</a></p></li><li><p>Kernel Panic <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Ubuntu_13.04_VirtualBox_Kernel_Panic.png" alt="Kernel Panic" loading="lazy"></p></li></ul><p>You will spend hours, maybe even days, tackling these issues, but when you finally fix them, you&#39;ll feel a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment. This experience is invaluable, as it greatly enhances your problem-solving skills, which is something Windows can&#39;t offer you.</p><p>For many distros, maintainance is done by the community, and you can always find help from the community. There are other distros that are made by companies, their communities are also active and helpful. While you are working on these issues, you will get help from the awesome Linux community (e.g. <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arch Linux Forums</a>, <a href="https://askubuntu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ask Ubuntu</a>).</p><p>Interest, as a common bond, can bring together people from different races, nationalities, and backgrounds to accomplish something remarkable.
